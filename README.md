This repository documents my transition from IT Support to IAM and DevOps engineering. It includes certifications, automation projects, security tooling, monitoring, and a final capstone project called SecureIDOps.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Master Okta, AWS IAM, and CIAM
- Automate infrastructure with Terraform & GitHub Actions
- Manage secrets with Vault
- Monitor IAM activity with Prometheus + Grafana
- Deploy IAM microservices using Kubernetes
